"""The orchestrator: question in, answer out (P5-T03 / #60).

Four steps, in this order, and the order is the security property:

    build  ->  sanitise  ->  send  ->  re-hydrate
      |           |            |           |
   tenant DB   tenant DB    satellite   tenant DB

Sanitisation sits between the database and the wire because that is the last
point at which the real values still exist inside the boundary
(AI_PLATFORM_DESIGN §5). Re-hydration sits after the response for the same
reason in reverse: the mapping never left, so only this database can restore the
identities.

This module is deliberately thin. Every piece of policy lives in the component
that owns it — context shape in the builder, PII rules in the sanitiser, budgets
and provider choice in the satellite. An orchestrator that starts making
decisions is an orchestrator that starts duplicating them.
